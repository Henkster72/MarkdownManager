# Millgrams experiment

Stanley Milgram demonstrated that roughly 80% of people will obey authority figures even when the orders are clearly immoral, harmful, or unlawful.

This isn’t about “evil people.” It’s about ordinary people outsourcing responsibility to power, uniforms, titles, procedures. Authority provides psychological cover. I was just following instructions becomes a moral anesthetic.

That leaves a small minority who hesitate, question, or refuse. Not because they are smarter or braver by default, but because they resist the comfort of obedience and accept personal responsibility instead.

Politically, this explains a lot: why abuses repeat, why systems persist long after they fail, and why accountability is always “someone else’s job.”

If you’re convinced you would be part of the resisting minority, it’s worth pausing. History suggests most people overestimate their own independence when authority is applied calmly, incrementally, and with official approval.

Milgram’s work is worth reading in full before assuming you’re the exception:
