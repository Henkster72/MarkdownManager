# Gut's Second Brain

Does my digestive system have a brain on its own? If so can you give references?

Yes, the digestive system is said to have a "second brain" known as the enteric nervous system (ENS). The ENS consists of more than 100 million nerve cells lining your gastrointestinal tract from the esophagus to the rectum. It's not a brain in the traditional sense as it doesn't think or decide for you, but it plays a crucial role in the gastrointestinal functioning by controlling digestion, from swallowing to the release of enzymes that break down food, to the control of blood flow that helps with nutrient absorption to elimination.

The ENS is capable of autonomous functions like coordinating reflexes; however, it communicates back and forth with the central nervous system (CNS), thereby linking the emotional and cognitive centers of the brain with peripheral intestinal functions. This communication is partly why stress and emotions can sometimes influence gastrointestinal symptoms.

References:
- "The Second Brain: A Groundbreaking New Understanding of Nervous Disorders of the Stomach and Intestine" by Michael D. Gershon is a seminal book that delves into the concept of the gut as a second brain.
- Research articles and reviews in journals such as Gastroenterology, Nature, and the Journal of Neuroscience often explore the functionality and importance of the ENS in both health and disease, highlighting its complexity and vital role in human physiology.

This concept has led to an increasing interest in the study of the gut-brain axis, which is the bidirectional communication pathway between the gut and the brain, and has implications for understanding a variety of conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome, stress, and even depression.
